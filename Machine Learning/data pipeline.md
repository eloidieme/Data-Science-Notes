A **sequence of data processing components** is called a data pipeline. Pipelines are very common in Machine Learning systems, since there is a lot of data to manipulate and many data transformations to apply.

Components typically run asynchronously. Each component pulls in a large amount of data, processes it, and spits out the result in another data store. Then, some time later, the next component in the pipeline pulls this data and spits out its own output. Each component is fairly self-contained: the interface between components is simply the data store.
