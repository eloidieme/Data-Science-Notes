You start with a certain amount of data. That might be a sample or it might be all of your available data. Regardless, that is all the data you’ll use to train your model. Once you have a model you’re satisfied with, you start making predictions. Over time you’ll determine that your model’s performance has degraded to a point where you feel it is time to re-train your model using more/newer data and features.

In batch learning, the system is incapable of learning incrementally: it must be trained using all the available data.
