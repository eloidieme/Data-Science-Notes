##### In broad categories, based on the following criteria:

Whether or not they are trained with human supervision:
- supervised
- unsupervised
- semisupervised
- Reinforcement Learning

Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly:
- online learning
- batch learning

Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and building a predictive model, much like scientists do:
- instance-based learning
- model-based learning
