In supervised learning, the training set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels.

Typical supervised learning task are classification and regression.
Here are some of the most important supervised learning algorithms:
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Neural networks (can be unsupervised or semisupervised)
