Sampling technique with which the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups called *strata*, and the right number of instances are sampled from each *stratum* to guarantee that the test set is **representative of the overall population.**

For example, the US population is 51.3% females and 48.7% males, so a well-conducted survey in the US would try to maintain this ratio in a 1000-person sample: 513 female and 487 male.
