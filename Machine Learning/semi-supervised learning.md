Some algorithms can deal with data thatâ€™s partially labeled. This is called semisupervised learning.

Example: Google Photos recognizes people in photos. Then they just need to be given a name once to be named in every single photo they appear in.

Most semisupervised learning algorithms are combinations of unsupervised and supervised algorithms.
