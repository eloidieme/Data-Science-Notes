Underfitting is the opposite of [[overfitting]]: it occurs when the model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data.

Here are the main options for fixing this problem:
- Select a more powerful model, with more parameters.
- Feed better features to the learning algorithm (feature engineering).
- Reduce the constraints on the model (e.g., reduce the [[regularization]] hyperparameter).
