The learning system, called an **agent**, can observe the **environment**, select and perform **actions**, and get **rewards** in return (or **penalties** in the form of negative rewards. It must then learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a **policy**, to get the most reward over time. A policy defines what **action** the agent should choose when it is in a given situation.
