The learning curves are plots of the modelâ€™s performance on the training set and the validation set as a function of the training set size (or the training iteration). To generate the plots, train the model several times on different sized subsets of the training set.

When a model is underfitting, the error is quite important and doesn't decrease when the training set size increases. The error over the training set and generalization error are quite similar.

Learning curves of an overfitting model.

When a model is overfitting, there is a significant difference between the error over the training set and the generalization error, the latter being higher. However, the bigger the training set, the closer the two curves get.
