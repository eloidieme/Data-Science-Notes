The Random Patches method is an [[ensemble learning]] method, in which bagging is performed for both the training samples and the features.
This is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional inputs (like images).

Sampling features results in even more predictor diversity, trading a bit more bias for lower variance.

A related method is the [[random subspaces]] method.
