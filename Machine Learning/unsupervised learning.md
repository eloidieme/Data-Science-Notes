In unsupervised learning, the training data is unlabeled. The system tries to learn without a teacher.

There are 6 main uses for unsupervised learning:
- Clustering
Clustering is used to identify groups within a dataset. The algorithm "creates" these groups by itself.

- Visualization 
You feed them a lot of complex and unlabeled data, and they output a 2D or 3D representation of your data that can easily be plotted.

- Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction **transforms** features into a lower dimension. The goal is to simplify the data without losing too much information. One way to do this is to merge several correlated features into one.
Building a new set of features from the original feature set is called feature extraction.

- Anomaly Detection
The system is shown mostly normal instances during training, so it learns to recognize them; then, when it sees a new instance, it can tell whether it looks like a normal one or whether it is likely an anomaly.

- Novelty Detection
Very similar to anomaly detection, this requires having a very “clean” training set, devoid of any instance that you would like the algorithm to detect.

- Association Rule Learning
The goal is to dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relations between attributes.
